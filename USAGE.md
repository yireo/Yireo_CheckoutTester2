# Usage
When you customize Magento 2 to your needs, conversion is everything. So part of the customization process will definitely include the checkout process, including the success page that is visited once the checkout
is completed. But when you refresh the success page, the session is cleaned up and you are redirected back to the cart.

This extension is ment to solve this specific issue. Instead of hacking the Magento 2 core, you can install our Magento2  extension in a simple and clean manner, and preview the success-page at any time. You simply
point your browser to the preview URL and voila, there's your success page:

    http://MAGENTO2/checkouttester/index/success

You can also test a specific order with the following:

    http://MAGENTO2/checkouttester/index/success/order_id/1234

## Tip
If you like this extension, make sure to view our EmailTester 2 extension. We do not want to build a shop without it.
